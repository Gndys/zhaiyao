## What is ZhaiYao?

ZhaiYao is an AI-powered meeting summary platform for teams that run frequent calls. It handles recording transcription, AI summaries, action-item routing, and knowledge archiving so every meeting becomes searchable and executable.

### Core Workflow

1. **Import meetings**: Upload mp3/mp4 recordings or connect live conferencing links such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Tencent Meeting.
2. **Automatic transcription**: Our hybrid acoustic models + Whisper deliver 30+ language support, speaker attribution, and noise robustness.
3. **AI summaries**: Choose templates (sales review, project weekly, investor updates, etc.) to generate highlights, risks, and next steps.
4. **Action-item distribution**: Detect owners and due dates; push tasks to Slack, Feishu, DingTalk, Jira, Notion, Confluence, or email.

### Platform Highlights

- Multi-device collaboration: edit transcripts in the browser or mobile clients with real-time co-editing.
- Enterprise security: encryption at rest/in transit, workspace isolation, RBAC, audit logs.
- Knowledge retention: sync outputs to documentation systems or APIs for future search and onboarding.
