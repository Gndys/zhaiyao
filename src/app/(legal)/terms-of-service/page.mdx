**Effective date:** 2024-01-01 (latest update: July 16, 2024)

These Terms of Service ("**Terms**") govern your access to and use of zhaiyao’s AI meeting assistant available at [https://zhaiyao.oline](https://zhaiyao.oline) (the "**Service**"). By creating an account, launching a trial, or using any feature (including audio uploads, transcript editing, structured summaries, or automated action-item routing) you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Service Description

ZhaiYao provides a cloud-based platform that:

- converts meetings or imported recordings into high-accuracy transcripts,
- generates summaries, highlights, risks, and next-step plans using AI templates,
- distributes action items to Slack, 飞书、钉钉、Jira、Notion、Confluence、email and other integrated tools,
- synchronizes knowledge to shared workspaces, analytics, and dashboards.

We may add or remove features at any time to improve the experience or maintain compliance. Some capabilities may be labeled as beta; they may be changed, suspended, or removed without notice.

## 2. Eligibility & Account Registration

1. **Legal capacity**: You represent that you are at least 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and authorized to bind the organization you act on behalf of.
2. **Account accuracy**: Provide complete and up-to-date information, including billing and contact details. You must update information promptly if it changes.
3. **Workspace security**: Keep credentials, tokens, and uploaded recordings secure. You are responsible for all actions under your account and must notify us at [zhankaisen60@gmail.com](mailto:zhankaisen60@gmail.com) if you suspect unauthorized use.
4. **Collaborators**: Workspace owners may invite teammates. You are accountable for ensuring each user complies with these Terms.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- upload or transmit content that infringes third-party rights, contains malicious code, or violates applicable laws;
- attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise extract source code from the Service;
- access the platform through automated scraping or rate-limit evasive methods;
- interfere with the integrity or performance of the Service;
- resell, sublicense, or offer ZhaiYao features as a competing service without written consent;
- use audio you lack the rights or consent to share.

We reserve the right to suspend or restrict accounts involved in abusive or unauthorized activity.

## 4. Customer Data & Intellectual Property

- **Customer Data**: You retain ownership of transcripts, recordings, summaries, and any content uploaded or generated on your behalf. You grant ZhaiYao a limited, worldwide license to process Customer Data solely to provide, maintain, and secure the Service, fulfill support, and comply with legal obligations.
- **Feedback**: If you share product feedback or suggestions, we may use it without restriction or compensation.
- **ZhaiYao IP**: All platform software, logos, models, documentation, and branding remain the exclusive property of zhaiyao. No rights or licenses are granted except as explicitly stated in these Terms.

## 5. Third-Party Services & Integrations

You can connect external services (e.g., Slack, Jira, Notion, 飞书). By enabling an integration, you authorize us to send the necessary information to the selected service. We do not control the privacy or security practices of third-party platforms; review their terms before connecting. ZhaiYao is not responsible for downtime or errors originating from third-party systems.

## 6. Trials, Plans, and Payments

1. **Trials & credits**: Free trials (such as 14-day enterprise access or 120 minutes of transcription credit) are provided for evaluation only. We may modify or terminate trials at our discretion.
2. **Subscriptions**: Paid plans are billed according to the selected tier (monthly or annual) and usage (e.g., transcription minutes). Charges recur automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date.
3. **Billing**: You authorize us and our payment processors to charge your designated payment method. All fees are non-refundable except as required by law. Late payments may lead to suspension.
4. **Taxes**: Fees exclude taxes, duties, or levies. You are responsible for applicable taxes.

## 7. Service Modifications and Availability

We strive to maintain high uptime and enterprise-grade security, but occasional maintenance or outages may occur. Features such as multi-language transcription, AI templates, or integrations may be adjusted to keep pace with technology and compliance requirements. We will provide notice of material changes when feasible.

## 8. Termination

You may terminate your workspace at any time via the admin settings. If you terminate in the middle of a billing period, fees already paid are not refunded. We may suspend or terminate access with notice if you materially breach these Terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or pose a security risk. Upon termination, access to workspace data may be disabled; you are responsible for exporting records beforehand.

## 9. Privacy

Use of the Service is subject to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which explains what information we collect, how we process it, and your rights. By using ZhaiYao, you consent to those practices.

## 10. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." ZHAIYAO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY OF AI-GENERATED CONTENT. We do not guarantee that summaries, speaker detection, or integrations will meet your requirements or be error-free.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law:

- ZhaiYao’s total liability arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service will not exceed the fees you paid to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
- ZhaiYao will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, goodwill, or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, the limitation will apply to the maximum extent permitted.

## 13. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where zhaiyao is established, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. Disputes will first be attempted to resolve amicably. If unresolved, they shall be submitted to binding arbitration in that jurisdiction, unless applicable law requires a different forum.

## 14. Changes to Terms
