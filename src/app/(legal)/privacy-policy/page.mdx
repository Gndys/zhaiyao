With your consent, we also use analytics cookies (e.g., to measure campaign效果) and may embed pixels in marketing pages to understand feature interest. You can manage cookie choices in your browser; disabling certain cookies could limit product functionality.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We process personal information for the following purposes:

1. **Deliver core functionality** – run高精度转写,生成多模板摘要,推送行动项,并在多终端保持一致体验。
2. **Provide customer support** – troubleshoot recordings, answer pricing or implementation questions, and send service notifications.
3. **Maintain platform security & integrity** – monitor misuse, prevent unauthorized access, and audit workspace活动 with细粒度访问控制。
4. **Improve产品体验** – analyze匿名化/aggregated usage signals to optimize转写准确率,模板表现,以及 Slack/飞书等集成稳定性。
5. **Communicate with you** – deliver onboarding tips, feature announcements, or marketing updates aligned with your communication preferences. You can opt out from promotional emails anytime.
6. **Process payments and invoicing** – calculate fees, detect fraud, and provide receipts according to applicable tax rules.
7. **Comply with legal obligations** – respond to lawful requests and enforce our agreements.

## 3. Legal Bases

Where required by law, our data processing relies on: (a) contract performance (providing the ZhaiYao service), (b) legitimate interests (product analytics, fraud prevention), (c) consent (marketing communications, optional integrations), and (d) legal obligations (tax, compliance, dispute handling).

## 4. Data Sharing and Processors

We never sell your personal information. We only share it with:

- **Technology providers** (cloud hosting, AI transcription partners, storage, and analytics vendors) who process data under confidentiality and data-processing agreements.
- **Integration partners** you choose to connect (e.g., Slack, Jira, Notion). We only transmit the data required to perform the requested sync.
- **Payment processors** to handle secure transactions.
- **Professional advisors or authorities** when required by law, court order, or to protect rights, safety, or security.

Whenever possible, data shared with partners is minimized or pseudonymized. Partners are prohibited from using your information for their own marketing.

## 5. Data Retention

- Workspace data, transcripts, and行动项 remain stored while you maintain an active account. You may delete individual files or request workspace deletion at any time; we will process the request within 30 days unless retention is legally required.
- Trial or dormant accounts may be deleted after reasonable notice.
- Billing, tax, and security logs are retained for up to 7 years (or longer if mandated by applicable regulation).

## 6. International Transfers

ZhaiYao operates globally using cloud infrastructure. When we transfer data outside your jurisdiction, we rely on legally recognized transfer mechanisms (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) and enforce contractual safeguards to maintain adequate protection.

## 7. Security

We apply multi-layered safeguards: encryption in transit and at rest, dedicated workspace isolation, role-based access control,操作日志, and periodic security reviews. No system can be guaranteed 100% secure, so we encourage you to use strong passwords, enable SSO where available, and contact us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you.
- Export transcripts or workspace content in a portable format.
- Restrict or object to certain processing activities.
- Withdraw consent for integrations or marketing at any time.
- Appeal decisions if we decline a data request.

Submit requests through your workspace admin settings or by emailing us at [zhankaisen60@gmail.com](mailto:zhankaisen60@gmail.com). We will verify your identity before fulfilling requests and respond within applicable regulatory timelines.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

ZhaiYao is designed for business and professional users. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or another age defined by local law). If you believe a child has provided us data, please contact us so we can delete it.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features (如新的会议来源、企业部署或任务集成) or legal requirements. Material changes will be announced via the dashboard or email, and the "Effective date" will be updated. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
